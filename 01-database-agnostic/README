= 01. Database Agnostic

Using ActiveRecord as an ORM to connect to data sources it makes it very easy to move from one database to another.

In this example we'll go from using a sqlite3 database to using a mysql database by changing a few lines of code.

== Dependencies

=== System

* ruby 1.8.7 or greater
* mysql
* sqlite

=== Gems

* rubygems
* activerecord 3.0.3 or greater
* mysql gem
* sqlite3-ruby gem

== Usage

ruby src/01-database-agnostic.rb database=mysql
OR
ruby src/01-database-agnostic.rb database=sqlite

== Digging In

* If you need to change your mysql setting, they are set around line 22
* Log files will be created for each case. (mysql.log and sqlite.log)

== Misc

While the example file is a little bloated it's goal is to show the whole process in a single file. Rails has conventions on where to abstract these pieces out to when using that framework.
